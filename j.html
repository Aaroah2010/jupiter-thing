    Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass (more
    than) two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but (a little) less than
    one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the
    Moon and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of
    the gods, because of its massive size.
    Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium comprises one quarter of its mass and one tenth of its volume.
    It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements,[17] but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined
    solid surface. The on-going contraction of its interior generates heat greater than the amount received from the
    Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable
    bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with
    turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant
    storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century, when it was first seen by telescope.
    Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail is nearly
    800 million km long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit. Jupiter has almost a hundred known moons and
    possibly many more,[18] including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the
    largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.
    Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in December
    1973.[19] Jupiter has since been explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer
    and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in
    1995.[20] In 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed
    and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter
    in July 2016.[21][22] Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid
    ocean of the moon Europa.

              The closer Earth and Jupiter are to each other, the brighter and larger Jupiter appears.</strong> Yes,
            Jupiter can be seen from the Earth without a telescope and, at its brightest can be the brightest object in
            the night sky (providing that the Moon and Venus are not visible). Jupiter is roughly twice as bright as the
            brightest actual star, Sirius.
